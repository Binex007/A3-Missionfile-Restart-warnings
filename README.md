ArmA 3 Server restart warning system by IT07

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Put the ScarCode folder included in this download into the root of your mission file. If you already have a ScarCode folder, merge them.
2. Read the instructions included with the code inside code_for_init.sqf and change it to your needs.
3. 3. If you happen to already have this in your init.sqf: "if(hasInterface) then {" (without the quotes) then copy all of the code from
code_for_init.sqf except line 1, 2 and 12. Then paste it inside the brackets of the hasInterface check in your init.sqf
4. If you do not have an "hasInterface" check in your init.sqf already, then copy ALL of the code from code_for_init.sqf into your own init.sqf.
It does not really matter where you paste it in terms of bottom, middle or top.
5. Enjoy my work :)
