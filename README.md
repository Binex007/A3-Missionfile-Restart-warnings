####INSTALLATION
Copy the ScarCode folder from GitHub into your own missionfile and merge them if the folder already exist.<br />
Then open code_for_init.sqf and put the code inside into your own init.sqf where it is appropriate for you to put it. <br />
Already have earlier version of this script? Then please remove all files associated with it.

####NOTE
This script is FREEWARE :) Which means that you can get this code without paying for it. It is kind of like legalized piracy lol. <br />
Anyway, it would be very sweet and kind of you to drop the developer a donation it would really help him! <br />
Just to give you an idea; the estimated development time of this script is 2 weeks.
